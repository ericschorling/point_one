This project takes an original location and survey data of a physical device in the field. It provides an interpretation of that data including graphs of potential movement and altitude changes.

## To Run the Application

If this is the first time installing you can run:

### `npm run build:first`

This will install all package.json files in root and subdirectories as well as create a build and start the application running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).


If this is not the first time running the application, in the root directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will clear old build files, create a new build, and start the application serving up the front end using a express static. 
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.
